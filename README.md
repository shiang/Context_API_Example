# Context_API_Example
Experiment of the new React Context API for better component management with user authentication and persisting authentication state throughout the app


Live example:

Append "/public" at the end of the url to go to the public page, or "/profile/" to go to the profile page.
The profile page requires the user to log in in order to see the profile detail. Use test account below to log in:

username: 'chicken@chicken.com',
password: 'chicken'
